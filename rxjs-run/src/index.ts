 * (to be given to drivers). A "collection of Observables" is a JavaScript
 * object where keys match the driver names registered by the `drivers` object,
 * and values are the Observables. Refer to the documentation of each driver to
 * see more details on what types of sources it outputs and sinks it receives.
